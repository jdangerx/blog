title: About

I am John Xia. I am a recent physics undergrad from the
[University of Chicago](http://www.uchicago.edu) and an "Associate Research
Specialist" in the
[Computational Nuclear Engineering Research Group](http://cnerg.github.io/) at
the University of Wisconsin-Madison.

I also do things that are not work.
