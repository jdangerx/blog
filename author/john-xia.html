<p><em>208. An aquagraphic-style water curtain that displays your team name or
logo. [250 points]</em></p>
<p>This is one of the items I worked on for <a href="http://scavhunt.uchicago.edu">Scav</a>
this year. I didn't complete it, but I will, someday.</p>
<p>Today I write about the original design and why it didn't work out. There's a
bonus section at the end about what the future holds.</p>
<p>My original concept was a wooden frame 18" tall and 12" wide. I mounted a PVC
pipe across the top as a water tank. I drilled small holes in the bottom of the
pipe to let the water out. 20
<a href="http://www.sciplus.com/p/12VDC-PULL-SOLENOID_51553">solenoids</a> were mounted in
a row next to the pipe; these moved in and out when I pulsed electricity through
them. Pieces of foamcore poster-board were attached to these solenoids as crude
valves for the water.</p>
<p>I connected the solenoids to a rotating drum (an old oatmeal container). I put a
gap in the circuit of each solenoid, which rubbed against the drum. If the drum
had a conductive coating where it touched the gap, it would complete the
circuit. This would activate the solenoid, opening the valve and letting water
out.</p>
<p>The end product would be that solenoids would fire in sync to whatever picture
was drawn on the drum, transferring the picture from drum to water.</p>
<p>It would be a cool machine - above and beyond what was asked of us. All the
wiring was pretty basic. It couldn't be that hard to make valves, could it?</p>
<p>Short answer: yes, it can!</p>
<p>Long answer: First, I tried sealing the holes from the outside by sticking a
foamcore flap next to each. It leaked horribly. Additionally, when the valves
<em>did</em> open, the water stuck to the flap and dripped at weird angles.</p>
<p>After much troubleshooting, Cecilie suggested that we seal the valves from the
inside. Instead of pushing a flap up against the outside of the hole, we would
have a plunger that went up and down over the hole. The water pressure would
push down on the valve, so it would help keep the valve closed. The sticking
would be conquered because there would be nothing downstream of the hole to mess
with the water. We redesigned the reservoir and moved the solenoids to the top
so they moved vertically. We had 12 hours left to complete this. We were gonna
make it!</p>
<p>But making accurate plungers out of foamcore is really, <em>really</em> hard. At 6AM
Sunday we found that they were all misaligned. The valves wobbled around on the
solenoid. The drum wasn't big enough for the wiring. The solenoids kept falling
off. We didn't have enough time.</p>
<p>I gave up, defeated. I presented it to the judges. I tried to tell them how cool
it would have been. I swore I would get it working eventually. They smiled and
told me to contact them when I did.</p>
<p>This summer I've gotten more excited about rebuilding it. Using
<a href="http://jdangerx.github.io/blog/fourthapp.html">our app</a> really showed me the
visceral joy of drawing things in plastic. Drawing with falling water would be
even cooler. I've been kicking some ideas around, to be covered in detail after
I implement them. Here they are:</p>
<p><strong>Idea Number One:</strong> 3D print the valve pieces. They'll be stiffer, more
consistent, and more accurate than the foamcore ones. They'll also attach to the
solenoids better if we design the pieces to be mounted securely. I should 3D
print mounts for the solenoids, too. These two combined should make the plunging
valve action very reliable.</p>
<p><strong>Idea Number Two:</strong> Make it taller. One problem some of the other teams
mentioned was that water falls quickly. To be able to see the picture for long
enough, we need to either make the water fall slower or make the screen
taller. Maybe both.</p>
<p><strong>Idea Number Three:</strong> Use a microcontroller or transistors to separate power
and control circuits. This allows faster timings. That leads to smaller
droplets, which fall slower. However, we are still limited by the speed of the
solenoids. That can be alleviated by making the solenoid travel much shorter,
facilitated by Idea One. This also means we would push less current through the
surface of the drum, which means we can use pencils and the like as the drawing
medium. A drawback of this system is that we would lose the direct connection
between the drawing and the water. It'd be less "pure".</p>

		</h2>
		<div class="entry-content">
			<p>In high school I built some bamboo bikes. The second one broke and I rebuilt it.</p>
<p>Here are their stories.</p>
<h2>v0.1</h2>
<p>One day I was biking with my friend Chris. I said to him that we should build a
bamboo bike in the summer. He said that that was a great idea and that we should
do it.</p>
<p>When summer started we bummed for bike parts around Palo Alto.</p>
<p>Somebody gave us an old frame that had been in a crash.</p>
<p><center>
<img src="http://jdangerx.github.io/blog/static/images/bamboo-bike/broken-frame.jpg" alt="" style="width: 400px;"/>
</center></p>
<p>We sawed the joints off.</p>
<p><center>
<img src="http://jdangerx.github.io/blog/static/images/bamboo-bike/joints.jpg" alt="" style="width: 400px;"/>
</center></p>
<p>Then we went to a bamboo garden in the hills and got some bamboo.</p>
<p>We heat-treated the bamboo, which both dries the bamboo and strengthens it. Then
we cut it into appropriate lengths and fit them onto the steel joints.</p>
<p><center>
<img src="http://jdangerx.github.io/blog/static/images/bamboo-bike/v01-layout.jpg" alt="" style="width: 400px;"/>
</center></p>
<p>The bamboo was loose on the steel tubes, so we filled the space with expanding
foam. Then we mixed up some epoxy resin, soaked twine in it, and wrapped
that around the joints to strengthen them.</p>
<p>The final product had some pretty wonky geometry, which was totally
different from what we had laid out earlier:</p>
<p><center>
<img src="http://jdangerx.github.io/blog/static/images/bamboo-bike/finished-v01.jpg" alt="" style="width: 400px;"/>
</center></p>
<p>The bottom bracket holder was very low to the ground, resulting in low ground
clearance. I had to be very careful to avoid pedal strike. I resolved to use a
jig the next time around.</p>
<h2>v0.2</h2>
<p>The next summer, having learned many lessons, I built another bike.</p>
<p><center>
<img src="http://jdangerx.github.io/blog/static/images/bamboo-bike/finished-v02.jpg" alt="" style="width: 400px;"/>
</center></p>
<p>I was happy enough to make an
<a href="http://www.instructables.com/id/Bamboo-Bike-Frame/">Instructable</a> about the
build process.</p>
<p>I rode this daily for several months, then one day the bottom bracket joint
snapped as I was crossing a street. So I started thinking about the next one.</p>
<p><center>
<img src="http://jdangerx.github.io/blog/static/images/bamboo-bike/riding-v03.jpg" alt="" style="width: 400px;"/>
</center></p>
<h2>v0.3</h2>
<p>For this one I redid the joints that broke with carbon fiber:</p>
<p><center>
<img src="http://jdangerx.github.io/blog/static/images/bamboo-bike/finished-v03.jpg" alt="" style="width: 400px;"/>
</center></p>
<p>First I tacked the joints back together. Then I built up the joints with
long-fiber Bondo, a two-part putty reinforced with fiberglass. I smoothed the
Bondo out with a Dremel, and started laminating the joint with carbon fiber.</p>
<p>I found a vacuum pump, made an air filter with activated charcoal and a metal
can, and bought some trash-bags. Then I was able to do some
<a href="http://ezinearticles.com/?Vacuum-Bagging-Carbon-Fiber-On-$50&amp;id=674586">crude vacuum-bagging</a>
of the joints.</p>
<p>As I waited for the epoxy to cure, I thought of a couple other ways I could have
joined the bamboo - forming the joints with smooth Bondo, using small bamboo
gussets, etc. The idea is to minimize the probability of kinks and air pockets
in the fiber by making the joint as smooth as possible. I'll have to test to see
which method works best.</p>

		<div class="entry-content">
			<p>I'm currently an intern at
<a href="http://www.missionst.com/">Mission St. Manufacturing</a>. We're a 3D
printing company that's trying to streamline 3D printing. If you're
not familiar with 3D printers, imagine building up an object with a
hot glue gun, carefully squeezing out layer upon layer of
plastic. That is exactly what a 3D printer does.</p>
<p>One of the problems we are fixing is that you have to jump through a
ton of hoops to print something. Making a 3D model is hard. Once you
have a model you have to turn that into instructions for your printer,
and once you have the instructions, you have to actually print
them. We hide most of this on our server so nobody has to deal
with it.</p>
<p>You can't hide the actual modeling, so we're making tablet apps that
make simple 3D modeling <em>really</em> simple.  We've got a few in the
works. Let's take a look at one that turns your finger drawings into
real things that you can hold. Its code name is FourthApp.</p>
<p>First you draw something. It's kind of like Paint. No spray-can, though.</p>
<p><center>
<img src="http://i.imgur.com/3Ve1p3b.jpg" alt="" style="width: 400px;"/>
</center></p>
<p>Then you hit print preview. We turn it into a 3D model and send it
back down for your perusal:</p>
<p><center>
<img src="http://i.imgur.com/ufGNaMuh.jpg" alt="" style="width: 400px;"/>
</center></p>
<p>If it turns out satisfactorily you can choose to print your part:</p>
<p><center>
<img src="http://i.imgur.com/xgTEGdsh.jpg" alt="" style="width: 400px;"/>
</center></p>
<p>Which ends up looking like this:</p>
<p><center>
<img src="http://i.imgur.com/vCxEIl5h.jpg" alt="" style="width: 400px;"/>
</center></p>
<p>You are, no doubt, curious as to how this all works. I'd love to tell
you, but first we need to understand the basics. Namely, what does
making a 3D model entail? Conceptually, it's pretty easy - you take a
picture, figure out what you want the model to look like, and draw
triangles on the model until it's all covered, like this:</p>
<p><center>
<img src="http://i.imgur.com/GsmBodl.jpg" alt="This is grabbed from an
open-source program called MeshLab." style="width: 400px;"/>
</center></p>
<p>Once you have that, you can cut it into thin horizontal slices; then
you can write instructions to tell the printer how to move on each
layer. This process is called <em>toolpath generation</em> or <em>slicing</em>.</p>
<p>However, the devil is in the details. We tried several different ways
of making models, which can be lumped into one of two categories:
path-based and image-based.</p>
<p>We started with a path-based method, which works like this: we track
the path the finger traces across the screen. Then we draw two paths
on either side, marking the bottom edges of the model. Then we play
connect-the-dots and make the triangles for the bottom face. Next we
make a copy of the bottom and move it up to make the top
face. Finally, we connect the top and bottom faces to each other to
make the sides. Ta-da!</p>
<p>This runs into some problems, though, when the path crosses over
itself. We end up with some triangles inside the model! The internal
triangles make it hard to determine the border of each slice. This
really messes with your toolpaths. We decided to try to detect the
self-intersections. This worked by checking each edge against each
other edge to see if they crossed. This is slow - when you start
drawing complex pictures, the brush noticeably lags behind your finger
as we accumulate more edges to check.</p>
<p>While trying to fix the code we started thinking about other
approaches. What if we took a screenshot and turned that into a 3D
model? We'd avoid the self-intersecting paths altogether - once you
have painted an area black, it doesn't matter if you go over it
again. It will still be black. It will be black until the end-times,
no matter how many times you draw over it. This was really exciting!
So we started hacking on it.</p>
<p>Soon we had something that kind of worked. The idea is pretty simple:
you look at each pixel in the picture, keeping track of how dark each
pixel is. This will correspond to height later. Each pixel has a 2D
position already. You can put that together with the heights you just
found to get a bunch of 3D points. Then you draw a bunch of triangles
in a giant game of connect-the-three-dimensional-dots, and voila! You
have a 3D model!</p>
<p>This method makes a lot of triangles. In fact, it makes about 10 times
as many as the last one. This means it's 10 times bigger, 10 times
harder to send over the Internet, 10 times harder to slice. To
alleviate these problems, we shrunk down the resolution of the images,
but ran into another snag: at such low resolutions, the beautiful,
organic curves (sensuous, even) that people were drawing became jagged
pixelated blocks. That can be helpful if you are trying to print out
characters from Super Mario, but that's not exactly what we want.  We
tried to find a happy medium between slow and pretty, but it wasn't
there.</p>
<p>Now we've hacked together another solution. The benefit of the
path-based approach is that the model itself is much smaller and
simpler; the benefit of the image-based approach is that we don't have
to deal with self-intersecting curves. A hybrid solution gets us both
of these. The app sends us a picture of what the user has drawn. Then
we use a nice program called
<a href="http://potrace.sourceforge.net/">potrace</a> to trace the edges of the
drawing. From there, we connect the dots and get a model which is as
simple and smooth as a path-based one without any of the
self-intersection issues.</p>
<p>Of course, there's still ways to improve. I'm working on an extension
to this hybrid method that will let you use different shades of grey
in your drawing to indicate different thicknesses. We can trace those
edges with potrace to get the profile of each slice. Then we can stack
them on top of each other to create the model. This lets you make
things that are bumpy on top. You'd <em>really</em> be getting somewhere.</p>
<p>Astute readers may notice that we don't need to turn the picture into
triangles to make toolpaths. All the printer does is fill in one
horizontal slice of the object and move up, so if we know what each
slice looks like we can make toolpaths straight from that. Luckily,
the different levels of grey represent exactly that! Instead of
stacking the slices, turning that into triangles, then slicing up the
triangles again, we can skip that middle step. This business of
translating between slices and triangles gets into deep waters very
quickly, though, and deserves its own post.</p>

			<h1>Introduction</h1>
<p>Every year, I partake in a four-day journey into madness called Scav (short for
the University of Chicago Scavenger Hunt). There are several teams of a few
dozen each; on the Wednesday night before Mother's Day we gather to receive the
<a href="http://scavhunt.uchicago.edu/list2014final.pdf">List</a>, which contains around
300 eccentric items. Then we madly sprint to complete as many items as
possible. On Mother's Day itself we gather to show off what we have scraped
together.</p>
<p>Here are a few of the items I've worked on through the years. They're
not... pretty. Think of them as early-stage prototypes.</p>
<h1>2011</h1>
<p>My first year. I didn't know that there was a "Big Projects" group specializing
in construction, so I signed up to take care of a page of the List. Here are
some of the items from my page.</p>
<h3>The Lamp</h3>
<p><em>37. One of those cheap, many-headed colorful dorm floor lamps. [1 point
per head, 30 bonus points if they can move unaided, 10 bonus bonus
points if it is tearing apart a small ship]</em></p>
<p><center>
<img src="http://jdangerx.github.io/blog/static/images/scav/lamp.jpg" alt="" style="width: 400px;"/>
</center></p>
<p>The mechanism was inspired by toys that look like this:</p>
<p><center>
<img src="http://jdangerx.github.io/blog/static/images/scav/chicken-toy.jpg" alt="" style="width: 400px;"/>
</center></p>
<p>You swing the ball around, pulling on the string going to each chicken's
head. This moves them up and down.</p>
<p>We didn't have motors, so to "move the heads unaided" I used a pulley and a
weight. We didn't have those either. I rigged up a pulley with cardboard taped
to a pipe. This rested inside a larger section of pipe so it could spin
freely. The weight was three water bottles in a plastic bag. I added rubber
bands to add tension to the string and move the heads back to their initial
positions.</p>
<h3>The Eyes</h3>
<p><em>40. Affix a pair of appropriately enormous googly eyes to the campus
building of your choice. [8 points]</em></p>
<p><center>
<img src="http://jdangerx.github.io/blog/static/images/scav/eyes.jpg" alt="" style="width: 400px;"/>
</center></p>
<p>We had planned on dangling them off the edge of the tower with wires. I
envisioned them swaying gently in the wind, pupils googling like mad for the
world to see. Getting these up wasn't hard - we just went up the stairs. Once we
got to the top, we found that the wind was too strong and the eyes flapped
wildly. Fortunately, we had duct tape and just leaned over the edge to secure
the eyes.</p>
<h1>2012</h1>
<p>This year, all the previous Big Projects folks had split, so I was heading up a
Big Projects team of one person (me). I holed up and worked on these items.</p>
<h3>The Piano</h3>
<p><em>146. Play me a drink, Sam, for old timesâ€™ sake...on your piano that
dispenses a beverage component with every keystroke. Changing the
melody should change the mixology. Instruments and their compositions
will be judged both on the quality of the cocktails and the musicality
of their recipes. [250 points, 25 extra points if your keyboard can
play a different melody to create a different drink]</em></p>
<p><center>
<img src="http://jdangerx.github.io/blog/static/images/scav/pianoclose.jpg" alt="" style="width: 400px;"/></p>
<p>It's a little bit hacked together.
</center></p>
<p>I mounted bottles filled with liquor (or mixer) on axles so their neutral
position would be right-side-up. I found these
<a href="http://www.sciplus.com/p/POWER-DOOR-LOCK_47851">automotive door lock actuators</a>
at ASS that would push upwards a few inches when I applied a voltage across
them. I attached the bottles so they would tip when the actuators fired. I
hooked up wires to a mini keyboard, turning each key into a switch that
activated one of the bottles. Now each note played corresponded to some alcohol
poured! The alcohol went through a 10-inch funnel into a glass.</p>
<h3>The Map</h3>
<p><em>264. Kingâ€™s Landing and The Twins are all right, I guess, but weâ€™d
rather see something a little more neo-Gothic. Produce a map of the U
of C campus that when triggered erects a clockwork version of a campus
building of your choice. [175 points]</em></p>
<p>We had to present this at 9:00 AM on Sunday. So we started at 6:00 that
morning. We had gears lying around, but no shafts. Luckily, the box of pens we
had bought were a great fit! So I got busy making a replica of the chapel I had
hung eyes from the year before.</p>
<p><center>
<img src="http://jdangerx.github.io/blog/static/images/scav/map.jpg" alt="" style="width: 400px;"/></p>
<p>One of many things we did not have time to make was a stand to hold it up.
</center></p>
<p>Turns out, ours was the only one with a building that had moving gears on
it. However, the motor that was supposed to lift the building up from under the
map burned out when we were presenting.</p>
<p>During these three hours I learned how hard it was to work with foamcore
poster-board. But I forgot all about that when I started on Aquagraphics in 2013.</p>
<h1>2013</h1>
<p>This year I assembled a Big Projects team! We could plan items together, build
them together, all that jazz. I spent a lot more time with the rest of the team,
helping people with their own technical items. This was much more fun than

<h3>The Liver</h3>
<p><em>84. Take us on a Fantastic Voyage through your teamâ€™s larger-than-life
model of a human organ. Your structure must be able to comfortably
accommodate at least four tourists at a time and present an accurate
and informative account of the organâ€™s inner workings. Weâ€™ll happily
enter the body part of your choice, but remember that our heart belongs
to the Franklin Institute. [150 points]</em></p>

<p>Here we are, shooing people into the liver.
</center></p>
<p>After much deliberation we settled on a liver. Because I like steel, we bought a
ton of electrical conduit and bent it into a frame. It was much lighter and
stiffer than a comparable wooden or PVC one. We covered it in about 80 feet of
chicken wire. When we started tarping the liver, we found that it was so light
that it blew away! So we got some rope and stakes to keep it on the ground.</p>

<p>We filled the inside with clear plastic tubes to represent the tubes inside the
liver. We hooked up some "bodily fluids" to the tubes: a bottle of sweet tea
vodka for bile and red Gatorade for blood. We also had long twisty balloons so
visitors could "fold their own proteins."</p>

			<p>One day I was reminiscing about my childhood and remembered seeing a cool
sculpture made only with steel tubes and cable. A bit of Googling revealed that
this was a
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tensegrity">tensegrity structure</a>. Tensegrity is
cool because it uses cables and rods to make a stiff structure without having
the rods touch each other.</p>
<p>I decided that I would make one myself. So for the next week or so, I got a few
forks every time I went to the dining hall. Some fishing-line and some dremeling ensued, and here is the result!</p>
