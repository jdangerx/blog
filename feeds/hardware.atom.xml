&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;jury-rigged a z-stop holder&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;had a jamming extruder&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;herringbone gears!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;tried all sorts of things to avoid dremeling the gear teeth&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;maybe the bolt isn't sitting straight?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;maybe the hole is off-center?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;maybe the motor needs to wobble more?&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the summer of 2011, I started volunteering with the wonderful folks in the
&lt;a href="http://blogs.exploratorium.edu/tinkering/"&gt;Tinkering Studio&lt;/a&gt; at the
Exploratorium. On the first day I showed up, they handed me a dustcloth and put
me to work dusting cabinets. I came back the next day and was immediately
offered the job of typing out labels for storage boxes. Once I finished with
that I got to play with the lasercutter.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the following summers I have been occupied with
&lt;a href="http://atom.stanford.edu/"&gt;other&lt;/a&gt;* &lt;a href="http://www.missionst.com"&gt;things&lt;/a&gt;, but I
go back and help out when I am in town. Here are some of the things I have
worked on while there:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Cardboard Iris&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is the first major project I worked on at the Tinkering Studio. We were in
the early stages of thinking about moving to a new space. One idea was that we
could have a room that we could close off to outside light, and one way to do
this was with an irising mechanism like that of a camera. Because we love cardboard, it was a natural choice for the prototype.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Drawdio Drinks Allotrope Laser Range-Finder Reflective Rotary Kinetiscope Wire&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Automata&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is Scav Hunt, and this is my role in it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;2011: The Lamp&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;37. One of those cheap, many-headed colorful dorm floor lamps. [1 point
per head, 30 bonus points if they can move unaided, 10 bonus bonus
points if it is tearing apart a small ship]&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;2011: The Eyes&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;40. Affix a pair of appropriately enormous googly eyes to the campus
building of your choice. [8 points]&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;2012: Piano&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;146. Play me a drink, Sam, for old times’ sake...on your piano that
dispenses a beverage component with every keystroke. Changing the
melody should change the mixology. Instruments and their compositions
will be judged both on the quality of the cocktails and the musicality
of their recipes. [250 points, 25 extra points if your keyboard can
play a different melody to create a different drink]&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;2012: Map&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;264. King’s Landing and The Twins are all right, I guess, but we’d
rather see something a little more neo-Gothic. Produce a map of the U
of C campus that when triggered erects a clockwork version of a campus
building of your choice. [175 points]&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;2013: Liver&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;84. Take us on a Fantastic Voyage through your team’s larger-than-life
model of a human organ. Your structure must be able to comfortably
accommodate at least four tourists at a time and present an accurate
and informative account of the organ’s inner workings. We’ll happily
enter the body part of your choice, but remember that our heart belongs
to the Franklin Institute.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;208. An aquagraphic-style water curtain that displays your team name or
logo. [250 points] †&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is one of the items I worked on for &lt;a href="http://scavhunt.uchicago.edu"&gt;Scav&lt;/a&gt;
this year. I didn't complete it, but I will, someday.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Today I write about the original design and why it didn't work out. There's a
bonus section at the end about what the future holds.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;4  35 200
My original concept was a wooden frame 18" tall and 12" wide. I mounted a PVC
pipe across the top as a water tank. I drilled small holes in the bottom of the
pipe to let the water out. 20
&lt;a href="http://www.sciplus.com/p/12VDC-PULL-SOLENOID_51553"&gt;solenoids&lt;/a&gt; were mounted in
a row next to the pipe; these moved in and out when I pulsed electricity through
them. Pieces of foamcore poster-board were attached to these solenoids as crude
valves for the water.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I connected the solenoids to a rotating drum (an old oatmeal container). I put a
gap in the circuit of each solenoid, which rubbed against the drum. If the drum
had a conductive coating where it touched the gap, it would complete the
circuit. This would activate the solenoid, opening the valve and letting water
out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The end product would be that solenoids would fire in sync to whatever picture
was drawn on the drum, transferring the picture from drum to water.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It would be a cool machine - above and beyond what was asked of us. All the
wiring was pretty basic. It couldn't be that hard to make valves, could it?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Short answer: yes, it can!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Long answer: First, I tried sealing the holes from the outside by sticking a
foamcore flap next to each. It leaked horribly. Additionally, when the valves
&lt;em&gt;did&lt;/em&gt; open, the water stuck to the flap and dripped at weird angles.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After much troubleshooting, Cecilie suggested that we seal the valves from the
inside. Instead of pushing a flap up against the outside of the hole, we would
have a plunger that went up and down over the hole. The water pressure would
push down on the valve, so it would help keep the valve closed. The sticking
would be conquered because there would be nothing downstream of the hole to mess
with the water. We redesigned the reservoir and moved the solenoids to the top
so they moved vertically. We had 12 hours left to complete this. We were gonna
make it!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But making accurate plungers out of foamcore is really, &lt;em&gt;really&lt;/em&gt; hard. At 6AM
Sunday we found that they were all misaligned. The valves wobbled around on the
solenoid. The drum wasn't big enough for the wiring. The solenoids kept falling
off. &lt;strong&gt;We didn't have enough time.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I gave up, defeated. I presented it to the judges. I tried to tell them how cool
it would have been. I swore I would get it working eventually. They smiled and
told me to contact them when I did.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This summer I've gotten more excited about rebuilding it. Using
&lt;a href="http://jdangerx.github.io/blog/fourthapp.html"&gt;our app&lt;/a&gt; really showed me the
visceral joy of drawing things in plastic. Drawing with falling water would be
even cooler. I've been kicking some ideas around, to be covered in detail after
I implement them. Here they are:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Idea Number One:&lt;/strong&gt; 3D print the valve pieces. They'll be stiffer, more
consistent, and more accurate than the foamcore ones. They'll also attach to the
solenoids better if we design the pieces to be mounted securely. I should 3D
print mounts for the solenoids, too. These two combined should make the plunging
valve action very reliable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Idea Number Two:&lt;/strong&gt; Make it taller. One problem some of the other teams
mentioned was that water falls quickly. To be able to see the picture for long
enough, we need to either make the water fall slower or make the screen
taller. Maybe both.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Idea Number Three:&lt;/strong&gt; Use a microcontroller or transistors to separate power
and control circuits. This allows faster timings. That leads to smaller
droplets, which fall slower. However, we are still limited by the speed of the
solenoids. That can be alleviated by making the solenoid travel much shorter,
facilitated by Idea One. This also means we would push less current through the
surface of the drum, which means we can use pencils and the like as the drawing
medium. A drawback of this system is that we would lose the direct connection
between the drawing and the water. It'd be less "pure".&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Idea Number Four:&lt;/strong&gt; Use transistors. This lets us separate the power and
control circuits. This is nice since we can get fast timings, but also because
we don't have to&lt;/p&gt;</summary><category term="scav"></category><category term="3D printing"></category></entry></feed>
