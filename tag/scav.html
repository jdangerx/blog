<p>Every year, I partake in a four-day journey into madness called Scav (short for
the University of Chicago Scavenger Hunt). There are several teams of a few
dozen each; on the Wednesday night before Mother's Day we gather to receive the
<a href="http://scavhunt.uchicago.edu/list2014final.pdf">List</a>, which contains around
300 eccentric items. Then we madly sprint to complete as many items as
possible. On Mother's Day itself we gather to show off what we have scraped
together.</p>
<p>Here are a few of the items I've worked on through the years. They're
not... pretty. Think of them as early-stage prototypes.</p>
<h1>2011</h1>
<p>My first year. I didn't know that there was a "Big Projects" group specializing
in construction, so I signed up to take care of a page of the List. Here are
some of the items from my page.</p>
<h3>The Lamp</h3>
<p><em>37. One of those cheap, many-headed colorful dorm floor lamps. [1 point
per head, 30 bonus points if they can move unaided, 10 bonus bonus
points if it is tearing apart a small ship]</em></p>
<p><center>
<img src="images/scav/lamp.jpg" alt="" style="width: 400px;"/>
</center></p>
<p>The mechanism was inspired by toys that look like this:</p>
<p><center>
<img src="images/scav/chicken-toy.jpg" alt="" style="width: 400px;"/>
</center></p>
<p>You swing the ball around, pulling on the string going to each chicken's
head. This moves them up and down.</p>
<p>We didn't have motors, so to "move the heads unaided" I used a pulley and a
weight. We didn't have those either. I rigged up a pulley with cardboard taped
to a pipe. This rested inside a larger section of pipe so it could spin
freely. The weight was three water bottles in a plastic bag. I added rubber
bands to add tension to the string and move the heads back to their initial
positions.</p>
<h3>The Eyes</h3>
<p><em>40. Affix a pair of appropriately enormous googly eyes to the campus
building of your choice. [8 points]</em></p>
<p><center>
<img src="images/scav/eyes.jpg" alt="" style="width: 400px;"/>
</center></p>
<p>We had planned on dangling them off the edge of the tower with wires. I
envisioned them swaying gently in the wind, pupils googling like mad for the
world to see. Getting these up wasn't hard - we just went up the stairs. Once we
got to the top, we found that the wind was too strong and the eyes flapped
wildly. Fortunately, we had duct tape and just leaned over the edge to secure
the eyes.</p>
<h1>2012</h1>
<p>This year, all the previous Big Projects folks had split, so I was heading up a
Big Projects team of one person (me). I holed up and worked on these items.</p>
<h3>The Piano</h3>
<p><em>146. Play me a drink, Sam, for old times’ sake...on your piano that
dispenses a beverage component with every keystroke. Changing the
melody should change the mixology. Instruments and their compositions
will be judged both on the quality of the cocktails and the musicality
of their recipes. [250 points, 25 extra points if your keyboard can
play a different melody to create a different drink]</em></p>
<p><center>
<img src="http://jdangerx.github.io/blog/static/images/scav/pianoclose.jpg" alt="" style="width: 400px;"/></p>
<p>It's a little bit hacked together.
</center></p>
<p>I mounted bottles filled with liquor (or mixer) on axles so their neutral
position would be right-side-up. I found these
<a href="http://www.sciplus.com/p/POWER-DOOR-LOCK_47851">automotive door lock actuators</a>
at ASS that would push upwards a few inches when I applied a voltage across
them. I attached the bottles so they would tip when the actuators fired. I
hooked up wires to a mini keyboard, turning each key into a switch that
activated one of the bottles. Now each note played corresponded to some alcohol
poured! The alcohol went through a 10-inch funnel into a glass.</p>
<h3>The Map</h3>
<p><em>264. King’s Landing and The Twins are all right, I guess, but we’d
rather see something a little more neo-Gothic. Produce a map of the U
of C campus that when triggered erects a clockwork version of a campus
building of your choice. [175 points]</em></p>
<p>We had to present this at 9:00 AM on Sunday. So we started at 6:00 that
morning. We had gears lying around, but no shafts. Luckily, the box of pens we
had bought were a great fit! So I got busy making a replica of the chapel I had
hung eyes from the year before.</p>
<p><center>
<img src="http://jdangerx.github.io/blog/static/images/scav/map.jpg" alt="" style="width: 400px;"/></p>
<p>One of many things we did not have time to make was a stand to hold it up.
</center></p>
<p>Turns out, ours was the only one with a building that had moving gears on
it. However, the motor that was supposed to lift the building up from under the
map burned out when we were presenting.</p>
<p>During these three hours I learned how hard it was to work with foamcore
poster-board. But I forgot all about that when I started on Aquagraphics in 2013.</p>
<h1>2013</h1>
<p>This year I assembled a Big Projects team! We could plan items together, build
them together, all that jazz. I spent a lot more time with the rest of the team,
helping people with their own technical items. This was much more fun than
working alone.</p>
<h3>The Liver</h3>
<p><em>84. Take us on a Fantastic Voyage through your team’s larger-than-life
model of a human organ. Your structure must be able to comfortably
accommodate at least four tourists at a time and present an accurate
and informative account of the organ’s inner workings. We’ll happily
enter the body part of your choice, but remember that our heart belongs
to the Franklin Institute. [150 points]</em></p>
<p><center>
<img src="http://jdangerx.github.io/blog/static/images/scav/liver-whole.jpg" alt="" style="width: 400px;"/></p>
<p>Here we are, shooing people into the liver.
</center></p>
<p>After much deliberation we settled on a liver. Because I like steel, we bought a
ton of electrical conduit and bent it into a frame. It was much lighter and
stiffer than a comparable wooden or PVC one. We covered it in about 80 feet of
chicken wire. When we started tarping the liver, we found that it was so light
that it blew away! So we got some rope and stakes to keep it on the ground.</p>
<p><center>
<img src="http://jdangerx.github.io/blog/static/images/scav/liver-internal.jpg" alt="" style="width: 400px;"/>
</center></p>
<p>We filled the inside with clear plastic tubes to represent the tubes inside the
liver. We hooked up some "bodily fluids" to the tubes: a bottle of sweet tea
vodka for bile and red Gatorade for blood. We also had long twisty balloons so
visitors could "fold their own proteins."</p>
<p><center>

<p>Some of the people who helped!
</center></p>
<h3>The Aquagraphics Curtain</h3>
<p><em>208. An aquagraphic-style water curtain that displays your team name or
logo. [250 points]</em></p>
