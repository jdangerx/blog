For my last game of [Humans vs. Zombies](http://www.uchicagohvz.org) I
decided that I would utilize the least effective strategy possible. I
optimized my weaponry for highest visibility, lowest mobility, and
lowest zombie-killing ability.

So, naturally, I went to the shop, found some scrap wood, and threw
together a back-mounted catapult, powered by twisted up bandanas of
HvZ's past. When that proved to be a little bit too pathetic I added
some rubber bands, increasing the range to about 30 feet. To defend
myself from zombies I needed to either set the catapult on the ground,
or get a nearby friend to be my gunner as I crouched down.

I did not kill any zombies with this.
