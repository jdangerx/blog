* Bamboo bike
  * mk I
    * used metal joints as a skeleton
    * used twine instead of raw matted fiber
    * geometry was wack
      * looks like we need a jig...
  * mk II
    * there is an instructable
    * some pics
    * it broke!
  * mk III
    * redid the joints with carbon fiber
      * bondo'd the bamboo together
      * vacuum bagging
      * as I was adding CF suddenly realized that smooth bondo + CF would be a
        good joint method. Alternatively, bamboo gussets + bondo
        * the idea is to have a smooth joint for the CF
        * would be nice to test...
