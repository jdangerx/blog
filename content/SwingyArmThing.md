I was in an art class last quarter, taught by [Hannah Givler](http://www.hannahgivler.com). 

This project is called "Module Matters". The prompt is to make a
reproducible module that can be used as a building block or an
integral part of a sculpture.

Initially I was doing a bunch of research on 3-D tiling, but I got distracted by
magnets and started thinking about cool magnetic things instead. After some
excited discussion with my friend Rachel I decided to CAD up a swingy arm thing
with magnets. The basic idea is that I have a stack of rotating arms
with magnets in their ends - this causes them to be loosely coupled in that
strange magnetic way. Then when you move any of the arms, the others move with
it. It's reminiscent of the
[Magnetic Wave Machine](http://exs.exploratorium.edu/exhibits/magnetic-wave-machine/)
at the Exploratorium.

I printed out a template from SolidWorks and traced that onto a scrap piece of lauan.

I cut it out with a bandsaw, then sanded it down.  Then I nailed a few
pieces of scrap together, using the template as a template, to make a
quick jig so I can drill holes precisely.

Then I traced the template 10 times onto a 2'x4' piece of 3/4" plywood, and cut
them all out with a bandsaw.

Then I used the template to route out the pieces smoothly, before putting them
in the drilling jig to make the pockets for the magnets and bearings.

I used skateboard bearings, because they're cheap and easy to find. They take
8mm axles, which is just a smidge bigger than the 5/16" threaded rod I used for
the axle. The arms were spaced out with washers between the bearings and secured
with a nut on each end.
