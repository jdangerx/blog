##Introduction

In the summer of 2011, I started volunteering with the wonderful folks in the
[Tinkering Studio](http://blogs.exploratorium.edu/tinkering/) at the
Exploratorium. On the first day I showed up, they handed me a dustcloth and put
me to work dusting cabinets. I came back the next day and was immediately
offered the job of typing out labels for storage boxes. Once I finished with
that I got to play with the lasercutter.

In the following summers I have been occupied with
[other](http://atom.stanford.edu/)\* [things](http://www.missionst.com), but I
go back and help out when I am in town. Here are some of the things I have
worked on while there:

##Cardboard Iris

This is the first major project I worked on at the Tinkering Studio. We were in
the early stages of thinking about moving to a new space. One idea was that we
could have a room that we could close off to outside light, and one way to do
this was with an irising mechanism like that of a camera. Because we love cardboard, it was a natural choice for the prototype.
