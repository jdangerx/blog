One day I was reminiscing about my childhood and remembered seeing a cool
sculpture made only with steel tubes and cable. A bit of Googling revealed that
this was a
[tensegrity structure](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tensegrity). Tensegrity is
cool because it uses cables and rods to make a stiff structure without having
the rods touch each other.

I decided that I would make one myself. So for the next week or so, I got a few
forks every time I went to the dining hall. Some fishing-line and some dremeling ensued, and here is the result!
