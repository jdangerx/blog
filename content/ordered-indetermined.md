Another project for my Data and Algorithms in Art class was to make
something "Ordered and Indetermined." This phrase was pretty much left
up to interpretation. I made some animations in JavaScript - this was
pretty much my introduction to the language. Screenshots follow.

My first idea was to make a juggling siteswap visualizer, which the
professor thought was uninteresting. So I stopped at making bouncing
blocks. I wondered what it would look like if I just made a ton of
bouncing rectangles:

The next idea, which I eventually presented in class, was
"ElevatorCorp", an idealized simulation of an office building where
all the workers do is ride elevators all day. I used
[three.js](http://threejs.org/) to talk to WebGL.
